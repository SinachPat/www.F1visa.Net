## 1. Product Vision

**F1Visa.Net is an AI-powered cooperative platform that helps international students navigate the F-1 visa journey with confidence, community, and ownership.**

Students get full platform access as a **Member** — **$9.99/month, or $48/year paid upfront**:

- **AI-guided visa application assistance** — form validation, deadline tracking, SEVIS compliance
- **Community portal** — live chat, peer forums, mentor matching with current F-1 holders
- **AI Readiness credential** — transferable AI literacy certification for careers

Membership does not include ownership. The first 100 students to become **Owners** (Founding Cooperative Members — **$99, one-time, for life**) additionally get cooperative ownership: voting rights, profit-share, and a stake in the platform's success. See [§7 Membership Tiers](#7-membership-tiers) for the full Member vs. Owner breakdown.

### North Star

> **"Every international student deserves access to affordable, trustworthy visa guidance and a community that helps them thrive — not just survive — their US education journey."**

## 3. Problem Statement

F-1 visa students face **three interconnected problems** that no single solution currently addresses:

### Problem 1: Complexity & Fear of Denial 🛂

| Issue | Detail |
|:------|:--------|
| **Opaque process** | I-20, SEVIS fee, DS-160, visa interview — each step has strict requirements |
| **High stakes** | A single error = delay or denial. Denial rate for F-1 visas: ~30-40% |
| **Cost of help** | Immigration lawyers: **$300-500/hr**. Existing forums: outdated/conflicting |
| **No AI guidance** | No tool specializes in F-1 visa process end-to-end |

### Problem 2: Isolation & Lack of Community 🏠

| Issue | Detail |
|:------|:--------|
| **Alone in a new country** | No family, no local network, no cultural navigation support |
| **Understaffed uni offices** | Average ratio: **1 advisor per 1,200 students** |
| **No peer matching** | No structured way to connect with fellow F-1 students |
| **Housing/banking/culture** | Basic settlement tasks are overwhelming without guidance |

### Problem 3: AI Literacy Gap 🤖

| Issue | Detail |
|:------|:--------|
| **Job market demands AI skills** | But F-1 students face barriers to acquiring them |
| **Expensive bootcamps** | AI courses cost $5,000-15,000 — out of reach for most students |
| **Work authorization limits** | First year: no off-campus work. No internships until CPT approved |
| **No structured pathway** | No affordable, credential-backed AI literacy program for students |

### Current Alternatives (All Inadequate)

| Solution | Cost | Coverage | Verdict |
|:---------|:----:|:--------:|:-------:|
| Immigration lawyers | $300-500/hr | ✅ Expert | ❌ **Too expensive for most students** |
| Reddit/r/f1visa | Free | ⚠️ Crowdsourced | ❌ **Conflicting advice, no accountability** |
| University ISSO | Free | ⚠️ Trusted | ❌ **1:1200 ratio — understaffed** |
| Indian study abroad agents | $500-2000 | ⚠️ Variable | ❌ **Conflict of interest, no post-arrival support** |
| General AI tools (ChatGPT) | $20/mo | ❌ Generic | ❌ **Not F-1 trained, no community** |

### 8.4 Product Analytics — PostHog Integration

**Status:** 🟡 **Code-complete, blocked on env config**

The PostHog SDK is integrated site-wide via the `Base` layout. All 10 pages load the client snippet; custom events are wired on the homepage, `/join`, `/oca`, and `/contact` (server-side). The integration is dormant until the PostHog project token is provided.

#### Implementation Status

| Component | File | Status |
|:----------|:-----|:------:|
| Client SDK loader | `src/components/PostHog.astro` | ✅ Merged |
| Layout injection | `src/layouts/Base.astro` (line 61) | ✅ All 10 pages |
| Server-side client | `src/lib/posthog-server.ts` (`posthog-node`) | ✅ Merged |
| Server capture (contact form) | `src/pages/contact.astro` | ✅ Merged |
| Custom events — homepage | `src/pages/index.astro` | ✅ Merged |
| Custom events — join | `src/pages/join.astro` | ✅ Merged |
| Custom events — OCA | `src/pages/oca.astro` | ✅ Merged |
| Env vars (`.env`) | `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN`, `POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN`, hosts | ❌ **Pending** |
| Live event verification | Browser DevTools + PostHog dashboard | ❌ **Pending** |

#### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Scope | Used by | Notes |
|:---------|:------|:--------|:------|
| `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN` | Client (browser) | `PostHog.astro` | Public key, starts with `phc_`. Inlined at build time. |
| `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` | Client (browser) | `PostHog.astro` | Defaults to `https://us.i.posthog.com` if unset. |
| `POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN` | Server (Worker) | `posthog-server.ts` | Same project token; used for server-side capture. |
| `POSTHOG_HOST` | Server (Worker) | `posthog-server.ts` | Defaults to `https://us.i.posthog.com` if unset. |

> **Deployment note:** `PUBLIC_*` vars are inlined at build time, so for Cloudflare they must be set as **build environment variables** in the Cloudflare dashboard (not `wrangler secret`). Server-side vars may use `wrangler secret put`.

#### Custom Events (beyond PostHog auto-capture)

| Event | Trigger | Page | Properties |
|:------|:--------|:-----|:-----------|
| `hero_cta_clicked` | Hero CTA click | `/` | `location` |
| `community_link_clicked` | Community nav link | `/` | — |
| `solution_card_clicked` | Solution card | `/` | `card` |
| `faq_item_expanded` | FAQ accordion | `/` | `item` |
| `assessment_cta_clicked` | Assessment CTA | `/join` | `location` |
| `membership_tier_selected` | Tier selection | `/join` | `tier` |
| `join_form_submitted` | Waitlist form submit | `/join` | `email` (via `posthog.identify`) |
| `oca_page_viewed` | Page load | `/oca` | — |
| `founding_member_cta_clicked` | Founding CTA | `/oca` | — |
| `contact_form_submitted` | Contact form (server) | `/contact` | `email`, `name` (via `posthog.identify`) |

#### Privacy Configuration (per §8.3)

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|:--------|:------|:----------|
| IP capture | ❌ Disabled | F-1 students cross borders; GDPR applies |
| Person profiles | Anonymous by default | Cheaper, privacy-first; `identify()` only after signup |
| Cookie consent | Required (separate task) | Add consent banner before paid social launch |
| Data retention | 90 days | Sufficient for analytics without over-retention |

#### Verification Checklist (run after env vars are set)

1. DevTools → Network → filter `posthog` → `array.js` loads 200
2. DevTools → Network → `batch` POST to `us.i.posthog.com/e/` contains `$pageview`
3. Navigate pages → additional `$pageview` events fire
4. Click hero CTA → `hero_cta_clicked` in batch payload
5. PostHog dashboard → "Waiting for events" clears within ~30s
6. PostHog → Web Analytics → Pageviews graph shows visits

## 11. Out of Scope (v1.0)

| Item | Reason | Future Phase |
|:-----|:-------|:------------:|
| Mobile app (native) | Web-first MVP — mobile-responsive WordPress sufficient | Phase 3 |
| H-1B visa support | F-1 focus first; H-1B = post-graduation transition | Phase 4 |
| Multi-country support (Canada, UK, etc.) | F-1 (US) is the core — expand later | S005 (2027) |
| AI-generated DS-160 auto-fill | Legal/regulatory risk — AI guides but doesn't submit | Phase 3 (with legal review) |
| Physical events/hackathons | Digital-first community; in-person = post-pandemic recovery | Phase 4 |
| University API integration (SEVIS) | Requires memorandum with individual universities | Phase 3 |

## 12. Risks & Mitigations

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|:-:|:-----|:----------:|:------:|:-----------|
| 1 | **USCIS/SEVP policy changes** — AI training data becomes out of date | 🟠 Medium | 🔴 High | Real-time policy monitoring via RSS; quarterly retraining cycles |
| 2 | **AI hallucination on visa regulations** — AI gives incorrect advice | 🟡 Low | 🔴 Critical | Human-in-the-loop review for all AI responses; disclaimer + escalation to mentors |
| 3 | **Bilingual AI inaccuracies** — Chinese translations miss cultural nuance | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | Z.ai GLM 5.2 already verified (Sage 🪷 + DRP.bot); continuous testing |
| 4 | **Low conversion: Free → Paid** | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | Free assessment delivers immediate value; newsletter nurture sequence |
| 5 | **Community moderation** — spam, misinformation, bad actors | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | AI moderation + human mentors; tiered trust system |
| 6 | **Stripe/PCI compliance** for $48/yr recurring | 🟡 Low | 🟠 Medium | Stripe handles PCI; minimal PCI scope |
| 7 | **Competitors copy model** | 🟡 Low | 🟡 Medium | Cooperative ownership is hard to replicate; community lock-in > feature lock-in |
